### Tool
The past couple of weeks, especially Sundays we have been thinking and tinkering with possible websites we want to use for our year-long project. Going through website after website I looked at many sites, played around, and skimmed through the examples given. I have now come to be in a good place where I have an idea as to what I want to do and the websites I feel comfortables using. As of today, I decided that I want to use the website [https://threejs.org(three.js)]. My main thought when choosing a website to learn was to choose the easiest website, but then after looking at a lot of them I realized that all the websites need the same amount of effort and determination to learn. Therefore, I stuck with the website that personally caught my eye. Three.JS is used to make many things from 3d images to games, 2d images, etc. Going through each of their examples was an adventure because of how intriguing or fun they were. 

### Idea
Following days, after examing most of the displays I began to better think of what I wanted to make. My first idea was to make a planning organizer that allowed people to add, remove, check things off, however, my idea did not fit the purposes of the website. There were far better websites specifically designed for this project and this website was just not one of the tools I needed. Being influenced by other people's images I brainstormed something interesting, I told myself that I want to make either a 3d image of a beating heart that beats/pumps up and down or an optical illusion that spins/moves slowly. By the end of the day, I chose the 3d image of a heart because that is something that I already kind of have pictured in my head, and how it would turn out. 

Though I haven't started coding, I read through two articles on the page [(https://threejsfundamentals.org(fundamentals)]. Some of the little things I learned along the way of fiddling with given code is: 
```
const intenisty =  3; /// the higher the number the more the base color disapears, and starts flashing instead
const fov = 100; /// the higher the number the further away the camera is from the cubes (makes its seem smaller)

cube.rotation.x = rot
cube.rotation.y = rot
``` 
^
This piece of code is what is used to make a 3d image move. When commenting these two functions out the image turned flat and was no longer 3d. 


### Challenges: 

In conclusion, though it definitely took a lot of time to figure out what I wanted to do, after finally deciding I am planning to work on doing more research as to figuring out how to better function this website. One of my biggest challenges throughout the period of tinkering would be reading and starting my research. I looked at a lot of readings and youtube videos, and something I did not like was how long it was. I tried skimming through but that was not working out because it's hard to understand one concept if you can't even understand the base. I learned with patience that I need to take my time carefully reading or else I would miss out on something important. Jotting down bullet points or notes helps a lot now and in the future so that was one of the quickest ways I turned to so I don't forget in the future.
